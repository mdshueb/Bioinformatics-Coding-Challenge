# NGS_Data_Analysis_Task
This repository contains solutions for two bioinformatics challenges: 1) Data Analysis and Statistics, focusing on analyzing and interpreting phased methylation patterns, and 2) NGS Alignment and Mutation Calling, which involves processing raw sequencing data, aligning reads to a reference genome, and identifying somatic mutations.
